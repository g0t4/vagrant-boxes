# TODO

NEXT UP need to add/review scripts and that should be about it!!

sudo worked in `sudo systemctl poweroff`
  FYI bento uses (AFICT for debian):
    echo 'vagrant' | sudo -S /sbin/halt -h -p
    # I don't think I need to pass the password, the first shutdown is after passwordless sudo is setup
