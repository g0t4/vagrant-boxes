I already (AFAICT) migrated my boxes. Here is the `vagrant registry` for my `wesdemos` boxes:
https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/services/vagrant/registries/wesdemos/boxes

Go to your org that owns registry:
- create new Service Principal + Key (save Client ID/Secret), very Amazon like config now
- update plugins to newer versions
